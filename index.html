<main>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the DoMake mobile application (“App”) handles information and protects your privacy.
    Please read it carefully.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <b>Summary:</b>
    The App is local-first and does not require accounts. Your tasks/notes/events are stored on your device.
    The App shows ads via Google AdMob. Depending on your region and choices, ads may be personalized or non-personalized.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Who we are (Data Controller)</h2>
  <p>
    Developer / Controller: <b>DevelMake Team</b><br />
    Contact email: <b>develmaketeam@gmail.com</b><br />
    Country: <b>Czechia</b>
  </p>

  <h2>2. What data the App stores</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Content you create</b> (tasks, notes, reminders, events, settings) is stored <b>locally on your device</b>.
    The App does not require registration and does not ask you for your name, email address, phone number, or payment details.
  </p>
  <p>
    For app functionality, the App may store small local technical values (for example, your preferences and timestamps
    like “last active”) inside the app’s private storage.
  </p>

  <h2>3. What data is collected for advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses <b>Google AdMob</b> (Google Mobile Ads SDK) to display ads. The App itself does not receive your identity.
    However, Google may collect and process certain device and usage information to provide ads, measure performance,
    and prevent fraud.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on your device and settings, Google may process data such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device and account identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>IP address (approximate location)</li>
    <li>Ad interactions / user product interactions (e.g., ad clicks, impressions)</li>
    <li>Diagnostic information (crash/performance data related to ad delivery)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Google Privacy Policy:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      https://policies.google.com/privacy
    </a>
  </p>

  <h2>4. Consent and privacy choices (EEA/UK/Switzerland)</h2>
  <p>
    In the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, the App uses Google’s consent solution
    (Google UMP / “Privacy & messaging”) to request your choices where required.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you consent, <b>personalized ads</b> may be shown.</li>
    <li>If you do not consent (or consent is required and not granted), the App requests <b>non-personalized ads</b>.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="box">
    <b>How to change/withdraw your choices:</b><br />
    In the App, open <code>Settings → Privacy → Ad consent</code> and reopen the consent form (if available in your region/device).
    You can also reset your Advertising ID in your device settings.
  </div>

  <h2>5. Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not use third‑party analytics SDKs such as Google Analytics or Firebase Analytics.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Payments</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not process payments or subscriptions.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Notifications</h2>
  <p>
    If you enable reminders, the App schedules <b>local notifications</b> on your device. Notification scheduling is handled locally.
    No notification content is sent to our servers (the App has no servers).
  </p>

  <h2>8. Sharing of data</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not sell your personal data. The only third-party processing described in this policy is related to advertising
    via Google AdMob, where Google may process data as described above for ad delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    Your content remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.
    Advertising-related data is handled by Google under their policies.
  </p>

  <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Google may process advertising data on servers located outside your country, including outside the EEA.
    Google explains its data processing and safeguards in its privacy documentation.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum digital consent age in your country).
    We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Your rights (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>
    Under GDPR, you may have rights such as access, deletion, and restriction of processing.
    Because the App stores your content locally, you can manage it directly in the App or by uninstalling the App.
    For advertising-related data processed by Google, you can use Google’s privacy controls and contact Google as described in their policy.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top shows the latest revision.
  </p>

  <h2>14. Contact</h2>

    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at <b>develmaketeam@gmail.com</b>.
