        This Privacy Policy explains how the Do, Make, List mobile application ("App")
        collects, uses, and shares information.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        Important: Replace the placeholders like [YOUR EMAIL] and the date before publishing.

      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        Developer: [YOUR NAME / COMPANY NAME]<br />
        Contact: [YOUR EMAIL]
      </p>

      <h2>Data we collect</h2>
      <p>
        The App does not require account registration and does not directly collect personal
        information such as name, phone number, address, or payment details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your tasks, notes, events, and reminders are stored locally on your device.
      </p>

      <h2>Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
      <p>
        The App uses Google AdMob to show ads. Google may collect device identifiers, IP
        address, and ad interaction data to provide ads and measure performance. In the EEA/UK,
        we use Google UMP (User Messaging Platform) to obtain consent for personalized ads.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you consent, personalized ads may be shown.</li>
        <li>If you do not consent, only non-personalized ads are shown.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Google Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a>
      </p>

      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        The App does not use third-party analytics SDKs (such as Google Analytics or Firebase
        Analytics).
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies and tracking technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Mobile apps do not use browser cookies. However, AdMob may use advertising identifiers
        and similar technologies for ad delivery and measurement.
      </p>

      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>
        The App does not process payments.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of
        digital consent in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information
        from children.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        Your data is stored locally on your device. You can remove it by deleting items
        in the App or uninstalling the App. Ad-related data is handled by Google according to
        their policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated date at the top
        indicates the latest revision.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
